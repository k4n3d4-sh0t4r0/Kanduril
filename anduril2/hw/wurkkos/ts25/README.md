# Wurkkos TS25

A quad LED 21700 light with FET+1 driver and RGB front aux.  A charge port is
built in too, but operates independently and is not visible to the main
firmware.

Some other Wurkkos models may also ship with this firmware, and should be
upgraded to use a more specific build:

  - FC13: use wurkkos-fc13
  - TS11: use wurkkos-ts11
  - SP30S Pro: use wurkkos-fc13

These builds have different aux LED behavior.  The difference is whether the
RGB aux is on the front, the side (button), or both.

  - Front: TS25
  - Side: FC13
  - Both: TS11
